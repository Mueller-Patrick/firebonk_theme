## State of development
The theme works fine in my HumHub installations, but I have not tested all possible settings and available modules.
That's why I recommend you to test the module with your settings, modules etc. and/or look through my code before activating it on a production site.

Please give me some feedback how it works for you.

## Changes in comparison to the community theme
### 1. Topic list in spaces and profiles
**Thanks to @raphaeljolivet** (see https://github.com/humhub/humhub/pull/4785) I was able to add a topic list to the left sidebar of spaces (only shown if there is at least one topic)

- bright dropdown menus (background same as topbar), text-color: @text-color-highlight instead of white
- color changes in comparison to the HumHub Community theme are mentioned in the file `less/variables.less`

#### Added hover effects
- see `less/mixins.less` (added color variable @hover)
- Hover for "view all" in the tasks widget header, see `less/tasks.less`

### 4. Restyled buttons
see `less/button.less`

### 6. Added Language Switcher in
- Login modal window, at the bottom
- Registration page, beneath the title

### 7. Editor for tasks, wiki, polls etc.: fixed non-floating menubar lead to a lot of scrolling on mobile
see `less/mixins.less` (solved with max-height)

### 8. Full-width Dashboard for guests
does not show the widget "New Spaces" in order not to show internal things to the public

### 9. [Some smaller things ...](DETAILS.md)
