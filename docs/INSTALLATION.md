# Installation

1. Upload the module to /protected/modules (or another module loader path) OR use `git clone https://github.com/felixhahnweilheim/humhub-themes-orange.git`
2. Enable the module in Administration > Modules
That's it. Since version 0.5 the theme is automatically activated.

If you try out the theme with another HumHub version than the corresponding, please rebuild the css file (`themes/themeOrange/css/theme.css`) (see the [HumHub Theming guide](https://docs.humhub.org/docs/theme/css#compile-css-package)).
