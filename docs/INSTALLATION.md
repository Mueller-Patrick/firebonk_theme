# Installation

1. Upload the module to /protected/modules (or another module path)
2. Enable the module in Administration > Modules
2. Select the theme at Administration > Settings > Appearance (save at the bottom)

If you try out the theme with another HumHub version than 1.10, please rebuild css/theme.css (see the [HumHub Theming guide](https://docs.humhub.org/docs/theme/css#compile-css-package)).

## Deactivating / Deleting
To be sure everything works correctly, I first choose the Community theme in Administration > Settings > Appearance (save at the bottom) and then deactivate the module. Then you can also safely delete the module.
